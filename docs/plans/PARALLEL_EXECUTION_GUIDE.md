## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Parallel Development (90-120 min)

**All agents start simultaneously:**

```bash
# Each agent creates their branch and begins work
Agent 1: git checkout -b agent1-web-dashboard
Agent 2: git checkout -b agent2-strategies-bollinger-meanreversion
Agent 3: git checkout -b agent3-strategies-breakout-stochastic
Agent 4: git checkout -b agent4-pr-agent
Agent 5: git checkout -b agent5-real-trading-binance
Agent 6: git checkout -b agent6-documentation
```

**Progress tracking:**
- Each agent commits after every 2-3 major steps
- Each agent requests review at designated checkpoints
- Lead developer reviews in order of completion

### Phase 2: Review Checkpoints (ongoing)

As agents hit checkpoints, they:
1. Commit their work
2. Push to remote
3. Post in coordination channel: "Agent X - Checkpoint Y complete. Ready for review."
4. Wait for feedback or continue to next checkpoint

Lead developer:
1. Reviews changes on agent's branch
2. Provides feedback or approval
3. Agent addresses feedback or proceeds

### Phase 3: Integration (30-45 min)

After all agents complete:

1. **Merge Order** (to minimize conflicts):
   ```bash
   # Core infrastructure first
   git checkout main
   git merge agent4-pr-agent        # PR Agent (minimal conflicts)
   git merge agent1-web-dashboard   # Web Dashboard

   # Strategies (independent)
   git merge agent2-strategies-bollinger-meanreversion
   git merge agent3-strategies-breakout-stochastic

   # Critical features
   git merge agent5-real-trading-binance  # Real trading (review carefully)

   # Documentation last
   git merge agent6-documentation
   ```

2. **Integration Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Run full test suite
   pytest -v

   # Start system
   python src/main.py

   # Verify dashboard
   open http://localhost:8000/dashboard

   # Check all agents running
   # Check all strategies active
   # Check web dashboard working
   ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts** (if any):
   - Most likely in: `config/app.yaml`, `src/agents/strategies/__init__.py`
   - Agents designed to minimize conflicts

---

## Communication Protocol

### Agent Status Updates

**Format**: `Agent X - Status: [message]`

**Examples**:
- "Agent 1 - Starting work on FastAPI backend"
- "Agent 2 - Checkpoint 1 complete. Bollinger Bands implemented."
- "Agent 5 - ⚠️ CRITICAL: Real trading code needs careful review"

### Review Requests

**Format**: `Agent X - Checkpoint Y complete. [Summary]. Ready for review.`

**Example**:
```
Agent 1 - Checkpoint 2 complete. REST endpoints implemented with tests.
Ready for review.
```

### Blocked Status

If an agent gets blocked:
```
Agent X - BLOCKED: [reason]. Needs: [requirement]
```

Lead developer addresses blocking issues first.

## Critical Guidelines for All Agents

### Code Quality

1. **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
   - Reuse existing patterns
   - Use base classes
   - Share utility functions

2. **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
   - Build only what's specified
   - No extra features
   - Keep it simple

3. **TDD** (Test-Driven Development)
   - Write tests first
   - Make them pass
   - Refactor

4. **Frequent Commits**
   - Commit after every 2-3 steps
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Push before requesting review

### Zero-Context Assumption

Each plan assumes the developer:
- ✅ Is skilled in Python/async
- ❌ Knows nothing about this codebase
- ❌ Knows nothing about trading
- ❌ Has questionable taste (detailed instructions provided)

### Testing Requirements

- Write tests **before** implementation
- Achieve >80% coverage
- All tests must pass before review
- Use mocks for external dependencies

### Review Checkpoints

Each agent has **3-5 checkpoints**:
- Checkpoint 1: After initial implementation
- Checkpoint 2: After main features
- Checkpoint 3+: Before completion
- Final: Request merge

At each checkpoint:
1. Run tests
2. Commit changes
3. Push to remote
4. Request review
5. Wait for feedback

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Agent 5 (Real Trading)**:
   - ⚠️ Involves real money
   - Requires extra careful review
   - Safety validation mandatory
   - Test on testnet first

2. **Merge Conflicts**:
   - Most likely: `config/app.yaml`
   - Resolution: Merge all strategy configs
   - Test after each merge

3. **Integration Issues**:
   - Database schema conflicts (unlikely - each agent has own migrations)
   - Import errors (check `__init__.py` files)
   - Event type conflicts (unlikely - well-defined)

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Clear Separation**:
   - Each agent works in isolated files
   - Minimal overlap in modified files
   - Independent branches

2. **Frequent Reviews**:
   - Catch issues early
   - Provide feedback quickly
   - Prevent cascading problems

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test after each merge
   - Full system test at end
   - Rollback plan if needed
